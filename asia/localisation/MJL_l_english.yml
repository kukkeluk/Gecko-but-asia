Despite his weak position when elected king in 1648, Frederik III's political skill allowed him to succeed in ousting two of his main adversaries in the Rigsråd as early as the 1650s. The two were the seneschal Corfitz Ulfeldt and the governor of Norway Hannibal Sehested, who were both married to Frederik's half-sisters. The king's heroic conduct during the siege of Copenhagen in the winter of 1659 had, in addition, made him widely popular at a time when the nobility and the Rigsråd were increasingly being discredited. In October 1660, these events led the estates - the nobility only reluctantly - to create a hereditary monarchy. The new system meant that the king was no longer dependent on the Rigsråd, and he immediately used his new power to introduce absolutism, which was temporarily established on 10 January 1661 in the Hereditary Monarchy Act before being fully set out in Kongeloven (the King's Law) of 1665, the basic law of Danish absolutism."

Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704, having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King. Then he subjugated Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish lands around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire in the peace treaties that followed."

Thereafter, Høegh-Guldberg, along with Prince Frederik and the dowager queen Juliana Maria, gained significant power in the Danish state. In 1774 Høegh-Guldberg was made confidential cabinet secretary. Soon, without consulting the other council ministers, he was issuing orders signed by the incompetent Christian VII.

When the French Revolution broke out, he condemned any interference in the domestic affairs of France and avoided every anti-French coalition. In March 1794 he negotiated a neutrality treaty with Sweden for protecting the merchant shipping of both countries by combined squadrons.

A captured ship would be sent to a Danish harbour where special courts, known as "Priseretterne", judged if the ship was "valid for capture". If it turned out to be "valid for capture", the ship and cargo would be auctioned to the highest bidder. The King who issued the commission would usually also gain a share of the prize.

As a result he was deposed in Denmark and Sweden and a year later in Norway, and the thrones passed to his nephew Christopher III von Wittelsbach of Bavaria. Erik who had tried in vain to make Duke Bogislav IX of Pomerania his successor as the next king of Denmark, finally accepted Christopher as king of the Kalmar Union in 1449 and returned Gotland back to Denmark while living his last days in Rügenwalde, Pommerania. \n \nChristopher's failure to deal with Erik's piracy caused economic decline and disgruntlement with Christopher in Sweden.

A norwegian engineer officer, colonel Anthon Coucheeron stayed in Fladstrand from 1685 to 1686 where he planned out the construction of a fortification which was later built in 1686-1690. The Fladstrand Citadel as it became known as, had a citadel facing the sea and with its stone tower "Krudttårnet" as well as the fortifications "Hornværket" protecting the citadel from land. The citadels main purpose was to safeguard Dano-norwegian transports between Denmark and Norway but became famous for being the naval base for the legendary admiral Peter Tordenskiold and later an important base for cannon boats during the Napoleonic wars. The Danish state also decided in 1805 to build a proper harbour and city by the citadel which is now known as Frederikshavn."

At first he had tried to woo the young Princess Eleonora but the house von Habsburg considered her too good for the Danish kingdom so he agreed to marry the even younger princess Isabella von Habsburg. It is said that the young Isabella immediately fell in love with [Root.Monarch.GetName] as soon as she saw a portrait painting of him and demanded the wedding to happen as soon as possible. Despite her young age, Isabella, who took the more Danish name, "Elisabeth" turned out to be a gifted politican and administrator which is why she became a trusted advisor to the king within his court. When King [Root.Monarch.GetName] was deposed in 1523 by disloyal noblemen supporting his uncle Duke Frederik, did the uncle contact Elisabeth through a personal letter written in her native german offering her a dowager queen's pension and permitting her to stay in Denmark under his protection. Elisabeth wrote back in Latin, stating that: "Ubi rex meus, ibi regnum meum", which means: "where my king is, there is my kingdom"."

The Danish King Frederik III wanted to support the defense in Jutland and strengthen the connection between Jutland and Funen, which is why it was decided to build a new fortification in the 1640's.

He instigated the peasants of Vendsyssel and North Jutland to rise up against the nobles. On 16 October 1534 the Jutland nobility that had been sent to crush the revolt met Clement's peasant army, enforced with professional soldiers from Count Christoffer. The nobility army was thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Svenstrup and the revolting peasants controlled a major part of northern Jutland for a couple of months. Noblemen were expelled and their manor houses were burned down by the peasants. The peasant army proved to be too poorly armed and too undisciplined though and King Christian III of Denmark made a separate peace with Count Christoffer. General Johan Rantzau was sent to fight the peasant revolt. The peasant army had retreated to Aalborg and strengthened the defenses of the city but after a hard battle in December 1534, Johan Rantzau's army defeated the peasants, overcame the defenses, sacked the city and killed 2000 people. Clement managed to escape, but was betrayed and captured by his enemies. He was kept in prison until the end of the civil war and was then executed by the breaking wheel."

Copenhagen and Malmö were able to hold out until 1536, when they were forced to capitulate after several months' siege. The Count's Feud was officially over. The nobles regrouped and healed the rifts through inter-marriage. The most powerful Danish nobility in Scania at this time, Bille and Brahe, protected their families and wealth through marriage. Beate Bille and Otte Brahe married to protect their families and formed a political alliance between the families with the marriage. The peasant consequences cost all parties dearly. Many were forced to purchase their lives with great gifts both to the king and to the nobles. The peasant's dissatisfaction was only made worse, as the nobility began to stick together even more after this incident. Christian III's rule saw the rise of royal absolutism in Denmark, and, with it, greater repression of the peasant classes. Another consequence of the Count's Feud was the introduction of a Swedish army into Scania, which whetted the Swedish appetite to gain the land for themselves..."

 flavor_swe.300.t: "Lund Universitet" 
 flavor_swe.300.d: "The city of Lund has a long history as a center for learning and was the ecclesiastical center and seat of the archbishop of Denmark. A cathedral school (the Katedralskolan) for the training of clergy was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school. \nThe university traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan studium generale (a medieval university) was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral (with baccalaureate degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by studia generalia in Uppsala in 1477 and Copenhagen in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral. \n\nAfter the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the Scanian lands came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish and culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named Academia Carolina after Charles X Gustav of Sweden until the late 19th century when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after Uppsala University (1477), the University of Tartu (1632, now in Estonia), the Academy of Åbo (1640, now in Finland), and the University of Greifswald (founded 1456; Swedish 1648–1815, now in Germany). \nThe university was at its founding granted four faculties: Law, Theological, Medicine and Philosophy. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were Samuel Pufendorf, a juridical historian; and Canutus Hahn and Kristian Papke in philosophy."

 flavor_swe.301.t: "A Description of the Northern Peoples" 
 flavor_swe.301.d: "The Swedish scholar and prelate, Olaus Magnus (1490-1557), last Catholic archbishop of Uppsala, lived the latter half of his life in exile. His devotion to his country and his people never faltered, nor his determination to give them a glorious place on the European cultural map by his writings. On his justly famous Carta Marina, published in Venice in 1539, he promised a fuller account of the North and its marvels. This he accomplished in January 1555 when he issued from his own press in Rome his magnificent Historia de Gentibus Septenrionalibus. This quarto volume of 815 pages, divided into 22 books and a total of 778 chapters, was lavishly illustrated with some 480 woodcuts, most of them closely relevant to the technical matters discussed by the author. The book was an immediate success, and half a dozen editions appeared in the century after Olaus’s death. It became even better known in an epitome published in Antwerp in 1558, which was also frequently reprinted and translated. This appeared in English in 1658, but it is only with the present version, complete with illustrations, that the whole work is made available to the English-reading world. It is indeed only the second full translation to appear in modern times, preceded a Swedish version published in four parts between 1909 and 1925. There is little history in the sense of chronological narrative in Olaus Magnus’s Historia. It is rightly regarded as an ethnographic essay on an encyclopaedic scale, touching on a vast variety of topics, snowflakes and sea-serpents, elks and artillery, sables and saltpetre, watermills and werewolves. Much of it was culled from ancient authorities- it was a matter of patriotic pride to identify the Swedes as the only legitimate descendants of the Goths- but much of it was derived from the author’s personal observations, especially those made on his early travels in North Sweden."

Until its dissolution in 1866, the institution was the highest authority in Sweden next to the King. It was a Diet made up of the Four Estates, which historically were the lines of division in Swedish society: \nClergy \nNobles \nBurghers \nFarmers \nThe Diet is a powerful tool and it would be wise for us to carefully navigate the internal politics of our nation. During Sweden's entire history, there have been a number of important assemblies ranging from times where the King had no power, to times where the King had all the power. \nThus, whichever authority we choose to support, let us do so while holding the good of the country in mind."

The full title is as appears on the right: Biblia / Thet är / All then Helgha Scrifft / på Swensko. The translation into English reads: "The Bible / That is / All the Holy Scripture / In Swedish". \nThe men behind the translation were Laurentius Andreae and the Petri brothers Olaus and Laurentius. Of them, Archbishop Laurentius is regarded as the main contributor. However, had the work not been commissioned by the Swedish King Gustav Vasa, who had in effect broken with the Pope in Rome in the 1520s, the work would not have been possible. \nThe Bible follows the German translation by Martin Luther from 1526 closely, not only in language, but in the fonts used and the typography as a whole. The Danish version, printed a few years earlier, also did this. \nThe Bible established the use of the Swedish language. It established a uniform spelling of words, particularly the infinitive ending -a instead of the more Danish-sounding -e, and defined the use of the vowels å, ä and ö. It did use th for /ð/, as in English, as is apparent on the title page; but this eventually changed to d."

During his reign, Sweden became one of the primary military forces in Europe during the Thirty Years' War, helping to determine the political and religious balance of power in Europe. He was formally and posthumously given the name Gustavus Adolphus the Great by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1634. \nHe is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in modern history, with use of an early form of combined arms. His contributions to Sweden's rise in power included reformation of the administrative structure. For example, he began parish registration of the population, so that the central government could more efficiently tax and conscript the people. His actions in the fields of economic reform, trade, modernization, and the creation of a modern bureaucracy were as significant as his actions in war. His domestic reforms, starting from a medieval economy and society, were the foundation for his victories in Germany as well as the creation and survival of the Swedish Empire. \nHe is widely commemorated by Protestants in Europe as the main defender of their cause during the Thirty Years' War, with multiple churches, foundations and other undertakings named after him, including the Gustav-Adolf-Werk. He became a symbol of Swedish pride."

The discontent was used by two Catholic priests, former Bishop Peder Jakobsson of Västerås, a follower of Sten Sture the Younger, and Knut Mickelsson, who opposed the inclinations of Lutheranism which the king had displayed as early as the 16th Century, who stirred up the emotions against the king and for the Sture family in the province."

Given the stresses of administrating the vast Swedish lands, the King, suspecting of imminent treason ordered the death of 5 prominent noblemen of the Sture family. Acting on madness and fear and deeply apologetic about his actions he sought the forgiveness of the Sture family who responded by demanding large sums of coin as well as land."

The name "Bollhuset" means "The Ball House", and it was built in 1627 for ball sports and used in this way for forty years. The name Lejonkulan, however, was, in fact, the name of a different building, which was also used by the same theater in the 17th century. \nBollhuset was the scene of a long series of most important events in the history of the theater in the city and in the history of Swedish theater. Between 1667 and 1792 it was used as a theater until it was demolished in 1793; between 1737 and 1754, the first national theater was located here; in 1773–1782 the Royal Swedish Opera (and thereby also the Royal Swedish Ballet) was located here; in 1783–1792 the French theater of Stockholm was housed here; in 1787 the second national theater was re-founded in the building; and from 1788 to 1792 it was the home of the Royal Dramatic Theatre."

This created a difficult political situation, as he had thereby technically abdicated and the nation was in interregnum. The Hovpartiet, a political party backing the monarch, suggested that the crisis could be used to stage a coup to establish absolute monarchy. The queen opposed because she did not consider the time right for such a step and advocated negotiation with the Hats (party) and the Caps (party), but at this point, the Hovpartiet for the first time turned to the Crown Prince rather than the queen; however, the crisis could not be used for a coup because the Caps party broke an agreement."
