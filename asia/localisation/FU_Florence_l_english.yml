 lan_strengthen_republic_desc: "Formed in 1138, when the Tuscan League united against King Henry X of Bavaria, our mighty republic has gone through a lot. From astounding victories to disgraceful defeats, the Florentine Republic has endured Fire, Ice, and Brimstone. We must not stop here however, the road that awaits our republic is one with obstacles.

 lan_la_misericordia_desc: "Originally founded as a lay confraternity in Florence in the 13th century by St. Peter Martyr with the aim of working towards the needy gestures of evangelical mercy, the foundation has since lost much of its initial funding. It is our duty to improve and expand its reach, for the preservation of our people's health."

 lan_renaissance_desc: "The Renaissance or the ‘Rebirth’ has marked an important phase in European History.

Embracing the Renaissance will surely bring about a Golden Age of Florentine Arts and Architecture!"

 lan_reorganize_city_wards_desc: "The Florentine Administrative Divisions, also known as the City Wards, are a cluster of messes, with random enclaves and exclaves, and undefined boundaries between different wards.

 lan_florin_lira_desc: "A strong currency is the sign of a prosperous Florence! Before our time, the markets of Europe, where all manner of goods are traded and sold, would conduct business either on a trade-basis or by trying to figure out currency exchange rates.

 lan_handle_papal_affairs_title: "Handle the Papal Affair"
 lan_handle_papal_affairs_desc: "To the South of our Republic, lies the Papal States, headed by the Pope, envoy of God himself. It is clear, from the example of Charlemagne and many other Great Kings, that the Nation which controls the Curia essentially controls the Western Christendom.

 lan_fiori_de_firenzia_desc: "Venice is the heart of Italy, or so the poets say.

 lan_italic_league_title: "Italic League"
 lan_italic_league_desc: "The dawn of the 15th century brings troublesome wars, conflicts and diplomatic alliances across Italy and beyond.

A member of the House of Auditore, Ezio remained unaware of his Assassin heritage until the age of 17, when he witnessed the hanging of his father and two brothers, Federico and Petruccio. Forced to flee his birthplace with his remaining family members—his mother and sister—Ezio took refuge with his uncle in the Tuscan town of Monteriggioni, at the Villa Auditore."
 
 
 #Events
 FU_Florence_Events.1.t: "Hall of the Five Hundred"
 FU_Florence_Events.1.d: "The Hall of the Five Hundred known in Italian as Salone dei Cinquecento is the largest and most important room in terms of artistic and jurisprudent value in Palazzo Vecchio. Recent gossip in our court undermines the credibility and democratic process of our Republic. As a way to counteract that, our Gonfaloniere sought to establish a more democratic government for the city of Florence and thus created the Council of Five Hundred (or Great Council), consisting of five hundred people, modeled after the Grand Council of Venice. In this way, the decision-making power belonged to a greater number of citizens, and it was more difficult for a single person to take control of the city. The tangible result of these reforms was the creation of the Salone dei Cinquecento in the government building, which involved a remarkable engineering effort."
 FU_Florence_Events.1.a: "Order! Order!"
 FU_Florence_Events.3.t: "The Halls of Intelligentsia" 
 FU_Florence_Events.3.d: "The intelligentsia is a status class composed of the university-educated people of a society who engage in the complex mental labours by which they critique, shape, and lead in the politics, policies, and culture of their society. As such, the intelligentsia comprises scholars, academics, and teachers, journalists and literary writers. Recent developments in the cultivation of talent across our nation has given birth to a second Renaissance across the various marketplaces of ideas."
 FU_Florence_Events.3.a: "Learning never exhausts the mind."
 FU_Florence_Events.5.t: "Cloth Centres of Florence"
 FU_Florence_Events.5.d: "Florence is well known as a cradle for Italian fashion.The city has been home to designers. While certainly not haute couture in the early-modern sense, the medieval Florentine textile trade enriched medieval fashion much in the same way. Throughout the 14th century, the city of Florence grew as a result of increased migration from the countryside. Florence expanded in relation to commerce because its natural surroundings were poor in resources. By the early 15th century, the local silk, cloth and wool industries had expanded. Immigration to the city, particularly from silk-workers in Italy’s Tuscany region and the increased demand for luxury textiles resulted in a lucrative business." 
 FU_Florence_Events.5.a: "You look dapper!"
 FU_Florence_Events.6.t: "The New Urban Planning Registration System"
 FU_Florence_Events.6.d: "Up until recent years, the land registration system of Florence was divided in archaic districts, held together by corrupt bureaucrats, defended by bought-and-paid-for political heads. Despite significant pushback, we have successfully managed to reorganize the entire registration system, maximizing entry efficiency and cutting down on tremendous amount of red tape!" 
 FU_Florence_Events.6.a: "Efficient development is the driving force of innovation and expansion!"
 FU_Florence_Events.7.t: "Arrival of the Gente Nuova"
 FU_Florence_Events.7.d: "War is the host of many calamities and destructions. As such, where destruction strikes people, many choose to abandon their homes in the search of a better future. Recent waves of pro-state immigrants have arrived at our door and it's up to us how to utilize these new citizens."

 FU_Florence_Events.8.t: "Girolamo Savonarola"
 FU_Florence_Events.8.d: "Girolamo Savonarola was born on September 21 1452 in Ferrara. A prolific Italian Christian preacher, reformer, and later martyr, renowned for his clash with tyrannical rulers and a corrupt clergy. After the attempted overthrow of the Medici in the late 15th century, Savonarola briefly became the sole leader of Florence, setting up a democratic republic. His chief enemies were the Duke of Milan and Pope Alexander VI, who issued numerous restraints against him, all of which were ignored. Despite his influence and say in clerical matters, he often resorts to threaten local leaders and elected politicians with prophecies of doom and destruction, comeuppance for decades of degeneracy and corruption. "

 FU_Florence_Events.8.b: "The musings of a madman..."
 FU_Florence_Events.9.t: "The Florentine Histories"
 FU_Florence_Events.9.d: "Machiavelli’s longest work (commissioned by Pope Leo X in 1520, presented to Pope Clement VII in 1525, and first published in 1532) is a history of Florence from its origin to the death of Lorenzo di Piero de’ Medici in 1492. Adopting the approach of humanist historians before him, Machiavelli used the plural “histories,” dividing his account into 'books' with nonhistorical introductions and invented speeches presented as if they were actual reports. His history, moreover, takes place in a nonhistorical context—a contest between virtue and fortune. The theme of the Florentine Histories is the city’s remarkable party division, which, unlike the divisions in ancient Rome, kept the city weak and corrupt. Like the Discourses on Livy, the Florentine Histories contains (less bold) criticism of the church and popes and revealing portraits of leading characters, especially of the Medici (the book is organized around the return of Cosimo de’ Medici (1389–1464) to Florence in 1434 after his exile). It also features an exaggeratedly 'Machiavellian' oration by a plebeian leader, apparently Michele di Lando, who was head of the 1378 Revolt of the Ciompi (wool carders), a rebellion of Florence’s lower classes that resulted in the formation of the city’s most democratic (albeit short-lived) government. Although not a modern historian, Machiavelli, with his emphasis on 'diverse effects,' exhibits some of the modern historian’s devotion to facts." 
 FU_Florence_Events.9.a: "An elegant account of Europe's history!"
 FU_Florence_Events.10.t: "Leonardo da Vinci Paints the Mona Lisa"
 FU_Florence_Events.10.d: "The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as 'the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world'. The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism. \n\nThe painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left it in his will to his favored apprentice Salai. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506. However, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and later became the property of the French Republic itself, on permanent display at the Louvre, Paris since 1797." 
 FU_Florence_Events.10.a: "Is she... smiling at me?"
 FU_Florence_Events.11.t: "Leonardo da Vinci Paints the Last Supper"
 FU_Florence_Events.11.d: "The Last Supper is a late 15th-century mural painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci housed by the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It is one of the Western world's most recognizable paintings. The work is assumed to have been started around [GetYear] and was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron, the Gonfaloniere of Florence. The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with the Twelve Apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John – specifically the moment after Jesus announces that one of his apostles will betray him." 
 FU_Florence_Events.11.a: "Florentine art is unrivaled!"
 FU_Florence_Events.12.t: "The Birth of Opera"
 FU_Florence_Events.12.d: "The Italian word opera means 'work', both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin word opera, a singular noun meaning 'work' and also the plural of the noun opus. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Italian word was first used in the sense 'composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined' in 1639 the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648. \n\nDafne by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the 'Camerata de' Bardi'. Significantly, Dafne was an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama, part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the Renaissance. The members of the Camerata considered that the 'chorus' parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles. Opera was thus conceived as a way of 'restoring' this situation. Dafne, however, is lost. A later work by Peri, Euridice, dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived until the present day. However, the honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed goes to Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo, composed for the court of Mantua in 1607. The Mantua court of the Gonzagas, employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the concerto delle donne (till 1598), but also one of the first actual 'opera singers', Madama Europa."

 FU_Florence_Events.13.d: "Ensuring the health and smooth operation of our country's various bridges and pathways such as the Ponte Vecchio and the Ponte alle Grazie is of vital importance to the continuous prosperity of our trade and uninterrupted growth. In order to mitigate damage and decay caused by weather and time, the board of the central office has decided to petition for the allocation of funds in order to repair and maintain the structures."

 FU_Florence_Events.14.t: "Office of the Night"
 FU_Florence_Events.14.d: "Originally petitioned to begin active service in [GetYear], the Office of the Night would oversee the smooth operation of nightly establishments such as taverns, gambling lots and the such. However, one of its most criticized and polarizing jurisdictions is the persecution of sodomy, homosexuality and heresy. Historically, Leonardo da Vinci was accused multiple times of homosexuality yet he was never convicted due to lack of evidence!" 
 FU_Florence_Events.14.a: "Establish the office."
 FU_Florence_Events.14.b: "Who are we to persecute people on their personal identity?"
 FU_Florence_Events.15.t: "The Age of Cosimo de Medici" 
 FU_Florence_Events.15.d: "Originally an Italian banker and politician who established the Medici family as effective rulers of Florence during much of the Italian Renaissance, Cosimo's power derived from his wealth as a banker, and he was a patron of arts, learning and architecture. He spent over 600000 gold florins on art and culture, including Donatello's David, the first freestanding nude male sculpture since antiquity. Despite his influence, his power was not absolute. Florence's legislative councils at times resisted his proposals throughout his life, and he was viewed as first among equals, rather than an autocrat." 
 FU_Florence_Events.15.a: "May he live forever more!"
 FU_Florence_Events.16.t: "Romantic Wanderlust of a True Bibliophile"
 FU_Florence_Events.16.d: "Cosimo had grown up with only three books, but by the time he was thirty, his collection had grown to 70 volumes. After being introduced to humanism by a group of literati who had asked for his help in preserving books, he grew to love the movement and gladly sponsored the effort to renew Greek and Roman civilization through literature, for which book collecting was a central activity. 'Heartened by the romantic wanderlust of a true bibliophile, the austere banker even embarked on several journeys in the hunt for books, while guaranteeing just about any undertaking that involved books. He financed trips to nearly every European town as well as to Syria, Egypt, and Greece organized by Poggio Bracciolini, his chief book scout.' He engaged 45 copyists under the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci to transcribe manuscripts and paid off the debts of Niccolò de' Niccoli after his death in exchange for control over his collection of some 800 manuscripts valued at around 6,000 florins. These manuscripts that Cosimo acquired from Niccoli would later be the cornerstone of the Laurentian Library, a library in Florence founded by Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo de' Medici." 
 FU_Florence_Events.16.a: "A wonderful collection!"
 FU_Florence_Events.17.t: "Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi"
 FU_Florence_Events.17.d: "Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi was born in 1396 and he is an Italian architect and sculptor. Considered one of the great pioneers of architecture during the Renaissance, Michelozzo soon became a favored Medici architect who is extensively employed by Cosimo de' Medici. He was a pupil of Lorenzo Ghiberti in his early years and later collaborated with Donatello. \n\nKnown primarily for designing Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, he is often overshadowed by his contemporaries Donatello in sculpture and Brunelleschi in architecture. 'He remained for his biographers a shadowy, active, competent, second-rate figure, circling around the glowing glory of the two dominant masters.'" 
 FU_Florence_Events.17.a: "A master amongst masters!"
 FU_Florence_Events.18.t: "Palazzo Medici Riccardi"
 FU_Florence_Events.18.d: "The Palazzo Medici-Riccardi is the former city palace of the Medici's, where this family actually lived. In [GetYear], the palace was built in Florence by Cosimo de Medici and Michelozzo. It remained in the hands of the Medici family for a century, but then it was sold to the Riccardi family. Catherine de 'Medici lived here, who later became Queen of France by marriage to King Henry II. The palace consists of two floors around a colonnaded courtyard, where statues from the sixteenth century can be seen."
 FU_Florence_Events.18.a: "Such design expertise and elegance!"
 FU_Florence_Events.19.t: "Fra Angelico"
 FU_Florence_Events.19.d: "Fra Angelico was born with the name Guido di Pietroin 1395 and is an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance, described by Vasari in his Lives of the Artists as having 'a rare and perfect talent'. He earned his reputation primarily for the series of frescoes he made for his own friary, San Marco, in Florence.\n\nHe was known to contemporaries as Fra Giovanni da Fiesole (Brother John of Fiesole) and Fra Giovanni Angelico (Angelic Brother John). In modern Italian he is called Beato Angelico (Blessed Angelic One). The common English name Fra Angelico means the 'Angelic friar'. "
 FU_Florence_Events.19.a: "The blessed angelic one!"
 FU_Florence_Events.20.t: "Donatello"
 FU_Florence_Events.20.d: "Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi was born in 1386. Better known as Donatello, he is an Italian sculptor of the Renaissance. Born in Florence, he studied classical sculpture and used this to develop a complete Renaissance style in sculpture, whose periods in Rome, Padua, and Siena introduced to other parts of Italy a long and productive career. Financed by Cosimo de' Medici, Donatello's David, was the first free-standing nude male sculpture since antiquity. \n\nHe worked with stone, bronze, wood, clay, stucco, and wax, and had several assistants, with four perhaps being a typical number. Although his best-known works mostly were statues in the round, he developed a new, very shallow, type of bas-relief for small works, and a good deal of his output was larger architectural reliefs." 
 FU_Florence_Events.20.a: "His creations will adorn our halls for centuries!"
 FU_Florence_Events.21.t: "Filippo Brunelleschi"
 FU_Florence_Events.21.d: "Filippo Brunelleschi was an architect and engineer, and one of the pioneers of early Renaissance architecture in Italy. He was the first modern engineer and an innovative problem solver, building his major work, the dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (the Duomo) in Florence, with the aid of machines that he invented specifically for the project." 
 FU_Florence_Events.21.a: "A true Renaissance man!"
 FU_Florence_Events.22.t: "The First Public Library in Florence"
 FU_Florence_Events.22.d: "Perhaps the best early expression of the modern concept of the public library is to be found in the establishment of the San Marco library, the first public library at Florence. The foundation of the library was Niccoli's Offsite collection. Niccoli's intentions were for his library to be brought 'to the common good, to the public service, to a place open to all, so that all eager for education might be able to harvest from it as from a fertile field the rich fruit of learning. Eventually, the executors of Niccoli's estate permitted Cosimo de' Medici to place the books in the library of the Dominican convent of San Marco, which Cosimo was then on the verge of constructing. The library opened in [GetYear] and was the first public library in Florence, containing 400 volumes laid out across 64 benches. The San Marco library embodied three different Renaissance concepts of a public library. It was the common library of the Dominican convent in which it was housed, a collection made available to a circle of humanist investigators, and an institution supported by the public patronage of an eminent ruler."
 FU_Florence_Events.22.a: "Books and manuscripts for all!"
 FU_Florence_Events.23.t: "The Debt of Niccolo de Niccoli"
 FU_Florence_Events.23.d: "Niccolò de' Niccoli was born in 1364 and he was an Italian Renaissance humanist.  His lack of critical faculty was compensated by his excellent taste. In Greek (of which he knew very little) he had the assistance of Ambrogio Traversari. Many of the most valuable manuscripts that would later reside in the Laurentian library are by his hand, amongst them those of Lucretius and of twelve comedies of Plautus. The pursuit of ancient manuscripts was a dangerous and expensive task, agents working in the field at the time included Poggio Bracciolini. Thanks to the patronage of Cosimo de' Medici, Niccoli was able to build up his personal library of 800 manuscripts. Niccoli was buried in the Basilica of Santo Spirito in Florence. He was in a great deal of debt prior to his death, after which Cosimo offered to cover all of his outstanding payments to debtors in exchange for control over his collection of 800 manuscripts valued at around 6,000 florins. He never married, preferring to fill his houses with manuscripts, coins, statuary, vases, and gems."

 FU_Florence_Events.24.t: "The Laurentian Library"
 FU_Florence_Events.24.d: "The Laurentian Library is a historic library in Florence, Italy, containing more than 11,000 manuscripts and 4,500 early printed books. Built in a cloister of the Medicean Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze under the patronage of the Medici pope Clement VII, the library was built to emphasize that the Medici were no longer merchants but members of intelligent and ecclesiastical society. It contains the manuscripts and books belonging to the private library of the Medici family. The library is renowned for its architecture, designed by Michelangelo, and is an example of Mannerism. \n\nA Codex Laurentianus identifies any of the book-bound manuscripts in the library. The library conserves the Nahuatl Florentine Codex, the Rabula Gospels, the Codex Amiatinus, the Squarcialupi Codex, and the fragmentary Erinna papyrus containing poems of the putative friend of Sappho."

 FU_Florence_Events.26.d: "The Medici giraffe was a giraffe presented to Lorenzo de' Medici in [GetYear] possibly by an emir or sultan from the Egypt and Arabian regions, in an attempt to win the support of the ruling Florentine family. It caused a great stir on its arrival in Florence. Although the central office maintained a large menagerie, and had previously featured a giant mannequin of a giraffe in the animal entertainments they provided to the citizenry, this was the first time a living example had been seen in the city. It was also reputedly the first living giraffe to be seen in Italy since the days of Ancient Rome. It did not survive for long and another giraffe was not seen in Europe for almost 300 years."

 FU_Florence_Events.27.t: "Homer in Print"
 FU_Florence_Events.27.d: "In [GetYear] the first printed edition, nominally called editio princeps of the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer appeared in Florence in two volumes. This edition of Homer's Opera in Greek was edited by the Greek scholar Demetrius Chalcondyles and printed by Bartolommeo di Libri at the expense of the brothers Nerli. It was the first printed edition of any major Greek work in its original language."

 FU_Florence_Events.28.t: "Machiavelli's Discourse on Livy" 
 FU_Florence_Events.28.d: "Like The Prince, the Discourses on Livy admits of various interpretations. One view stresses the work’s republicanism and locates Machiavelli in a republican tradition that starts with Aristotle (384–322 bc) and continues through the organization of the medieval city-states, the renewal of classical political philosophy in Renaissance humanism, and the establishment of the contemporary American republic. This interpretation focuses on Machiavelli’s various pro-republican remarks, such as his statement that the multitude is wiser and more constant than a prince and his emphasis in the Discourses on Livy on the republican virtue of self-sacrifice as a way of combating corruption. Yet Machiavelli’s republicanism does not rest on the usual republican premise that power is safer in the hands of many than it is in the hands of one. To the contrary, he asserts that, to found or reform a republic, it is necessary to 'be alone.' Any ordering must depend on a single mind. Thus, Romulus 'deserves excuse' for killing Remus, his brother and partner in the founding of Rome, because it was for the common good. This statement is as close as Machiavelli ever came to saying 'the end justifies the means,' a phrase closely associated with interpretations of The Prince."

 FU_Florence_Events.29.t: "Ordo Botanico di Firenze" 
 FU_Florence_Events.29.d: "The garden was established on December 1, 1545, by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and is Europe's third oldest, behind the Orto Botanico di Pisa and the Orto Botanico di Padova. It was first laid out by landscape gardener Niccolò Pericoli to a botanical system and plantings chosen by Luca Ghini, and rose to prominence under Cosimo III, with Pier Antonio Micheli as its director. As was typical of early European botanical gardens, its prime interest was in medicinal plants. However, as in 1753 the Società Botanica was formed, the garden's focus turned to 'experimental agriculture' and its layout was revised accordingly. The garden grounds opened to the public in the mid-19th century, at about the same time that its glass houses (1694 square metres) were constructed."

 FU_Florence_Events.30.t: "Accademia delle Arti del Disegno"
 FU_Florence_Events.30.d: "The Accademia delle Arti del Disegno, or 'Academy of the Arts of Drawing', is an academy of artists in Florence, Italy. The Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno, or 'academy and company of the arts of drawing', was founded on 13 January 1563 by Cosimo I de' Medici, under the influence of Giorgio Vasari. It was made up of two parts: the Company was a kind of guild for all working artists, while the Academy was for more eminent artistic personalities of Cosimo’s court, and supervised artistic production in Tuscany. It was later called the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno. \n\nArtists including Michelangelo Buonarroti, Lazzaro Donati, Francesco da Sangallo, Agnolo Bronzino, Benvenuto Cellini, Giorgio Vasari, Bartolomeo Ammannati, and Giambologna were members. Most members of the Accademia were male; Artemisia Gentileschi was the first woman to be admitted. \n\nIts declared purposes are the promotion and diffusion of the arts, and the protection and conservation of cultural heritage worldwide. It organises conferences, concerts, book presentations and exhibitions, and elects noted artists from all over the world to honorary membership.    " 
 FU_Florence_Events.30.a: "Interesting."
 FU_Florence_Events.31.t: "The Florentine Camerata is Formed"
 FU_Florence_Events.31.d: "The Florentine Camerata are an important group of musical amateurs who met to discuss literature, science and the arts. The earliest recorded meeting was in [GetYear] at Count Giovanni Bardi's house. The group was not formally organized, and it is unclear as to who all might have participated in the discussions. It is known that Vincenzo Galilei and Giulo Caccini frequented the group, but it is likely that Jacopo Peri, Ottavio Rinuccini and Girolamo Mei also participated. Members of the Camerata were largely concerned with a revival of the Greek dramatic style. It is from these experimentations that the stile recitativo was invented. It was thought that the Greeks used a style between speech and song, and this is what this development produced. This style was used in several monodies and intermedi of the day, but became primarily linked with the development of opera. It is indeed the formulation of opera in the realm of music that both Florence and the Florentine Camerata are most famous for."

 FU_Florence_Events.32.d: "Ezio Auditore da Firenze was born in the mid 15th century. He was a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance, and, unbeknownst to most historians and philosophers, a spymaster and the prime trustee of Florence's most powerful family, the Medici, a title which he held for several years. A member of the House of Auditore, Ezio remained unaware of his Assassin heritage until the age of 17, when he witnessed the hanging of his father and two brothers, Federico and Petruccio. Forced to flee his birthplace with his remaining family members—his mother and sister—Ezio took refuge with his uncle in the Tuscan town of Monteriggioni, at the Villa Auditore.  After learning of his heritage from Mario, Ezio began his Spymaster training and set about on his quest for vengeance against those who had ordered the execution of his kin."
